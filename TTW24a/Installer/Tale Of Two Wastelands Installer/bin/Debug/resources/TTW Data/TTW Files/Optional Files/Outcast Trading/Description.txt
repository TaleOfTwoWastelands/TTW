Instead of using the dialog menu, outcasts instead use a barter menu, giving you fair prices for tech and offering loads of low tech supplies for purchase, such as ballistic ammo and weapons, food, water, and stimpacks.
As your reputation with them increases, they offer better stuff for sale and will eventually sell you small amounts of energy weapons and ammo.

Will be integrated into TTW, but is currently being tested.
