ABOUT

The Team has Completely rebuilt TTW from the ground up.  We have an all new one step installer and the download has been greatly reduced in size.

By downloading and running this installer you agree that you understand the following:

This is an ALPHA, we have done out best to fix most major bugs before opening it to the public, but there will still be bugs, and some may be game breaking.
EVERYTHING is subject to change. This may on occasion require you to start a whole new game. We will do our best to keep forced restarts to a minimum, but it may happen.
Use of mods, especially in large numbers, can lead to unforeseen problems. We suggest you keep your load order short until we declare the alpha phase over. During beta phase, we will start focusing on mod compatibility and troubleshooting. If you choose to run TTW with large amounts of mods, be warned that the development team will probably not have the time to help you resolve your issues.
This version requires all Fallout 3 downloadable content and all Fallout New Vegas downloadable content: The Pitt, Operation Anchorage, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, Mothership Zeta, Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Gun Runners Arsenal. The easiest way to acquire all DLC content is to purchase Fallout 3 Game Of The Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.

Courier's Stash (Courier's stash includes all pre-order packs: Caravan Pack, Classic Pack, Mercenary Pack, Tribal Pack) is now optional. 

TTW no longer alters any of Fallout New Vegas's original .esm's or .bsa's so at any point you can turn off TTW just like any other mod and, go back to vanilla FNV. From a modder's perspective this is a good thing because you can use the GECK to mod vanilla FNV as you could before you installed TTW.

INSTALLATION

Download releases at taleoftwowastelands.com. This is also the best place to get help and support.

Launch the installer .exe file by right-clicking on it and choosing "Run as Administrator".  THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.
 
When the installer loads, make sure it has found the correct location of both your Fallout 3 and, Fallout New Vegas Installs. If not use the browse button to navigate to the correct game directories.
 
In the install location field, use the browse button to navigate to your preferred TTW installation directory. DO NOT INSTALL DIRECTLY TO YOUR FNV DIRECTORY.
 
Click Install. 

 Watch the log and the progress bars to see how things are going.
 
The installer can take between 10 to 30 minutes depending on the speed of your computer.  Primarily, it is based on your hard drive speed.  For example, users with solid state drives, fast processors, and lots of ram will have about 10 minute install times. 
When the installer finishes it will ask if you would like it to make a FOMOD; TTW is much easier to install with a mod manager - see our website for recommendations.  If you would rather do a manual install we have instructions for that as well.

Make sure your mod manager is closed. Navigate to the TTW install directory and move the FOMODs (TaleOfTwoWastelands_Main.fomod, TaleOfTwoWastelands_Options.fomod) to your FOMM FNV mods folder (C:\Games\FalloutNV\mods by default)
 
Open FOMM and click on the "Package Manager" button. A new window should open and you should see two new FOMODs (Tale of Two Wastelands - Main files, Tale of Two Wastelands - Optional Files). Install Main Files first and the Optional Files afterward.
NOTE: FOMM will become "(Not Responding)" and freeze for a while when installing the main TTW fomod, that is because the size of the fomod file is huge and FOMM needs to unpack and move several GB of data, this takes time. Do not close FOMM until it finished and loses the (Not Responding) status.
