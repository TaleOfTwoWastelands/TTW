ABOUT

Tale Of Two Wastelands releases are available at taleoftwowastelands.com

We have an all new one step installer and the download has been greatly reduced in size.

By downloading and running this installer you agree that you understand the following:

This is an ALPHA, we have done out best to fix most major bugs before opening it to the public, but there will still be bugs, and some may be game breaking.
EVERYTHING is subject to change. This may on occasion require you to start a whole new game. We will do our best to keep forced restarts to a minimum, but it may happen.
Use of mods, especially in large numbers, can lead to unforeseen problems. We suggest you keep your load order short until we declare the alpha phase over. During beta phase, we will start focusing on mod compatibility and troubleshooting. If you choose to run TTW with large amounts of mods, be warned that the development team will probably not have the time to help you resolve your issues.
This version requires all Fallout 3 downloadable content and all Fallout New Vegas downloadable content: The Pitt, Operation Anchorage, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, Mothership Zeta, Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Gun Runners Arsenal. The easiest way to acquire all DLC content is to purchase Fallout 3 Game Of The Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.

TTW does not alter any of Fallout New Vegas's original .esm's or .bsa's so at any point you can turn off TTW just like any other mod and, go back to vanilla FNV. From a modder's perspective this is a good thing because you can use the GECK to mod vanilla FNV as you could before you installed TTW.

INSTALLATION

Full installation instructions are available under "Alpha Download" on taleoftwowastelands.com, as well as tips on using different mod managers and troubleshooting tips. We're almost always available to help as well.
